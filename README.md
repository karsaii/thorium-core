# thorium-core
A core set of Java extensions - "record" functionality, command pattern, generic shortcome workarounds, among other things.

One of the most daunting things about Java is the lack of records, tuples, data classes. Whichever you prefer.
This package tries to address that with the Data class, a factory to provide shotgun-constructors, etc.
It also provides a functional Command/Pipe pattern.

Provides a few generic boilerplate classes (just what were needed).
